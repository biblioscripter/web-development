 **Title: Understanding the Difference Between map() and forEach() Methods in JavaScript**

**Introduction:**
In JavaScript, the `map()` and `forEach()` methods are two commonly used array methods that perform different operations on each element of an array. While both methods iterate over the elements of an array, they have distinct purposes and return different results. This README aims to provide a detailed explanation of the code snippet you provided, highlighting the key differences between `map()` and `forEach()` methods.

**Code Snippet:**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Using the map() method
const a = numbers.map((num) => {
    return num * 2;
});
console.log(a);

// Using the forEach() method
const b = numbers.forEach((num) => {
    return num * 2;
});
console.log(b);
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`map()` Method:**
   - The `map()` method creates a new array by applying a specified function to each element of the original array.
   - In the code snippet, the `map()` method is used to multiply each element of the `numbers` array by 2.
   - The `map()` method takes a callback function as an argument, which is executed for each element of the array.
   - The callback function receives the current element of the array as an argument and returns a new value.
   - In this case, the callback function returns the current element multiplied by 2.
   - The result of the `map()` method is a new array (`a`) containing the transformed elements.
   - When you log the `a` array, you will see the output: `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`.

2. **`forEach()` Method:**
   - The `forEach()` method iterates over each element of the original array and executes a specified function for each element.
   - Unlike the `map()` method, the `forEach()` method does not create a new array.
   - The `forEach()` method takes a callback function as an argument, which is executed for each element of the array.
   - The callback function receives the current element of the array as an argument, but it does not return a value.
